In my tests, I've found that certain modifications need to be made in order to fully solve some environments.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to submit a PR!

## Continuous Environments
- Generally require large batch sizes, e.g. 8192
- If `sigma` starts to increase instead of decrease on TensorBoard, try using fewer epochs

### `Pendulum-v0`
- Works fine across a broad range of settings

###  `MountainCarContinuous-v0`
- Not fully tested yet

### `LunarLanderContinuous-v2`
- Not fully tested yet

### `BipedalWalker-v2`
- Reward scaling can sometimes cause issues due to the -100 penalty
- Works best with separate actor-critic networks when using LSTM e.g. `ppo_lstm.py`
- Per episode advantage normalisation when using LSTM (instead of per batch) seems to be more stable
- Small amount of L2 kernel regularisation e.g. 0.0001 helps smooth out the reward curve to get above 300 points. Scores around 320-330 are possible with the deterministic policy once trained

### `BipedalWalkerHardcore-v2`
- Not solved - need a more robust exploration mechanism (curiosity?)

### `CarRacing-v0`
- Works best with a joined actor-critic e.g. `ppo_lstm_joined.py`
- Not sure why the reward curve goes through highs and lows. Maybe need to play with epochs/learning rate

## Discrete Environments
- Generally require small batch sizes, e.g. 128
- Work in progress...

### `CartPole-v1`
- Works fine with small batches

### `Pong-v0`
- Work in progress...
